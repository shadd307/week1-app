To understand the unmounting phase, we need to go in Dev tools by clicking on inspect option, then click on Components.

For FunctionalComponentExample, select the "MyComponent" and you will value of the hook State as "false". 
As its false so the component is not mounted and you dont see anything on the webpage.
Make it true by checking the State value.
The webpage will be updated when the component gets mounted.
Make it false again by unchecking the State value.
The webpage will be updated when the component gets unmounted.
