To understand the unmounting phase, we need to go in Dev tools by clicking on inspect option, then click on Components.

For ClassComponentExample, select the "MyComponent" and you will see value of the state "deleteSampleComponent" as "true". Make it false by unchecking it.
So the "SampleComponent" will get deleted and you will see alert message while its getting unmounted.
